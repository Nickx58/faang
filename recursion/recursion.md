# Notes for Recursion

Things to keep in mind while solving the resursion

1. Smaller version of the problem
2. Base case is very important
3. Solve it on pen and paper to understand. Draw the recursive tree
4. Use helper function if needed.
5. Check for the parameters and arguments
6. Return from recursion -> e.g if the typ of recursion function is int when calling the reursion function again
   remember to add return return binarySearch();
